# README

1. Always create a new branch to work on, never push to master branch.

2. Please study [Creative Tim Tutorial](https://demos.creative-tim.com/material-kit-pro-react/#/documentation/tutorial), it greatly reduces the stress developing CSS and components.

3. This project use [Unstated](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/unstated), please study it, it is much easier than Redux.

4. Try to pickup basic of [CircleCI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CB7vnoXI0pE), I strongly suggest that we cultivate devOps culture as early as possible.

5. This repository is created from [create-next-apollo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-apollo), check it out to learn how Next + Apollo + Unstated work together.
